# Node-mongo learning project

This is node-mongo project. Learning node and mongoDb, made a server. 
In this project I have used express.js instead of raw node. To run the server use 'node index.js' command
or simply can use 'npm start' cause nodemon added.

### Technologies used

- express.js
- cors
- body-parser
- nodemon
